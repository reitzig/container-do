Feature: Container Setup
    We want to be able to trigger certain setup steps from the config file
    so we do not have to manually repeat those steps whenever the container
    has to be recreated.

    Background:
        Given docker is installed

    Scenario: Setup via Script File
            # TODO

    Scenario: Setup via Command List
            # TODO
